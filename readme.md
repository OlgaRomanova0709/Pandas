#  Academy of Py
I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results using student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data and showcased the obvious trends in school performance.
The final report includes the following:

# District Summary

Created a high level snapshot (in a table form) of the district's key metrics, including:

--Total Schools
--Total Students
--Total Budget
--Average Math Score
--Average Reading Score
--% Passing Math
--% Passing Reading
--Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

# School Summary

Created an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school

School Name, 
School Type, 
Total Students, 
Total School Budget, 
Per Student Budget, 
Average Math Score, 
Average Reading Score, 
% Passing Math, 
% Passing Reading, 
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)


# Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

Created a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. It includes:

School Name, 
School Type, 
Total Students, 
Total School Budget, 
Per Student Budget, 
Average Math Score, 
Average Reading Score, 
% Passing Math, 
% Passing Reading, 
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)


# Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

Created a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. It includes all of the same metrics as above.


# Math Scores by Grade**

Created a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


# Reading Scores by Grade

Created a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


# Scores by School Spending

Created a table that breaks down each school performance based on the average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Used 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. it includes in the table each of the following:

Average Math Score, 
Average Reading Score, 
% Passing Math, 
% Passing Reading, 
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two

# Scores by School Size

Repeats the above breakdown, but this time groups schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).


# Scores by School Type

Repeats the above breakdown, but this time groups schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
